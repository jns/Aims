This project serves as a ruby interface to the FHI-Aims ab-initio molecular simulation package. It provides a set of tools for parsing and generating the input and output files for AIMS. 

In addition there are tools for generating crystal geometries and slicing those crystals along arbitrary planes defined by their miller index.
